might be related to the Apollo era in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This is characterized by the tall blue bars. After that, the investment drops off, which coincides with the end of the Apollo program.\n### Mars Missions: \nMars appears to have consistent investment over many years, with fluctuations. This suggests a sustained interest in Mars exploration, possibly with multiple missions such as rovers, orbiters, and landers.\n### Outer Planets Missions: \nThe tall yellow bars indicate substantial investments at certain intervals. These could represent flagship missions to the outer planets, such as the Galileo or Cassini missions.\n### Venus Missions: \nThe green bars represent missions to Venus, which seem to occur less frequently and with less investment compared to Mars or the outer planets.\n### Mercury, The Sun, Small Bodies, and Earth-Sun L1 Missions: \nThese categories have smaller and less frequent investments, shown by the shorter bars of various colors. This suggests that while these destinations are of interest, they may not be as high of a priority or require less budget compared to missions to the Moon, Mars, or outer planets.\n### Trends Over Time: \nOverall, there seems to be a diversification of mission destinations over time, moving from a heavy focus on the Moon during the early years to a more varied spread across different solar system destinations in the later years.\n### Recent Years: \nIn the most recent years on the right, there is a notable presence of missions to Mars and the outer planets, indicating continued or renewed interest in these destinations.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"de9cd027-5e91-42e7-aa84-66e929b128fa"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
